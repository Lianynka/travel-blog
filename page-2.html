                <p class="text" id="text-page">Is the fate of many unique, virtually abandoned villages in the unknown
                    corner of Abruzzo sealed? Not if Swedish-Italian millionaire Daniele Kihlgren can help it. In 1999,
                    a solitary motorbike trip proved to be a revelation for this modern-day idealist. By chance, he
                    stumbled upon the almost-deserted hilltop village of Santo Stefano di Sessanio in the Gran Sasso and
                    Monti della Laga National Park in the Apennines. He was struck speechless, not only by the
                    outstanding beauty of the setting, but also because almost everything was untouched. “Time seemed to
                    have stood perfectly still – no concrete buildings, no factories, no tourist infrastructure like the
                    Swiss chalets you find in so many Abruzzese towns,” says Kihlgren. It wasn’t long before he returned
                    to Santo Stefano – not only with his motorbike, but also with a plan to save this village from
                    extinction. Kihlgren, in his mid-forties, has been described as a maverick, a millionaire with
                    enormous willpower. And where there’s a will, there’s a way. Kihlgren bought a house in Santo
                    Stefano and soon many more. Next step was signing a deal with the local authorities to leave Santo
                    Stefano in its original condition – in other words, an embargo on building new houses and a ban on
                    the use of concrete. In exchange, Kihlgren would spend a substantial sum, up to €4.5 million – a mix
                    of his own and borrowed money – on breathing new life into the village and giving it a second
                    chance. “This has nothing to do with renovation,” Kihlgren insists. “It’s about restoration –
                    restoring honour. I had a unique opportunity to save one of the last authentic places in Italy from
                    the grip of cement.” In 2004, five years after Kihlgren first wandered through Santo Stefano, the
                    village was ready for its second life. Kihlgren received help from some big names, including the
                    renowned British architect David Chipperfield, who also supports the concept of ‘conservative
                    restoration’, or restoring while maintaining original features.</p>
